This is a Next.js project using https://pokeapi.co/. 
## Getting Started
To be safe, run:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

Then build a production build with:
```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

To run the production server (for optimal lighthouse results)

```bash
npm run start
# or
yarn start
```

## Lighthouse Results:

## Loom Demo

## Futher Improvements
- CSS variables for type colors
- Mobile styling polish
- If this was prod would also not be loading images from URLS
